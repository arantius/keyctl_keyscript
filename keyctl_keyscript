# keyctl_keyscript - to use in /etc/crypttab as keyscript
#  allows to cache passwords for cryptdevices for 60s
#  password is linked for cryptdevices with the same _FAKE_ keyfile
#  keyfile is the value of the 3. field from /etc/crypttab if keyscript is used
#
# sample crypttab entries:
# test1   /dev/loop1    /etc/inittab    luks,keyscript=/sbin/keyscript
# test2   /dev/loop2    /etc/inittab    luks,keyscript=/sbin/keyscript
# test3   /dev/loop3    /etc/passwd     luks,keyscript=/sbin/keyscript
#
#  test1 and test2 have the same identifier thus test2 does not need a password
#  typed in manually
#
#  hint: at first the identifier '/etc/inittab' seems strange, though it's
#        choosen that the crypttab script does not error out because of a
#        missing file.
